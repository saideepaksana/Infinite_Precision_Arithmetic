# Infinite Precision Arithmetic

## Overview
Infinite Precision Arithmetic is a project that enables precise arithmetic operations beyond standard data type limitations. It follows an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach.

## Features
- Supports large number arithmetic.
- Uses OOP for modularity and reusability.
- Integer and Float classes work together as friends.

## Limitations
- Division by zero is not handled.
- Zero output is not displayed.

## Compilation & Usage
1. Download all files into the same directory.
2. Open a terminal in that directory.
3. Compile using:
   ```sh
   make
   ```
4. Run the program as per the project instructions.

## Future Improvements
- Handle division by zero.
- Display zero outputs correctly.

## License
Open-source and free to use.
